Help me write proper prompt details for a web Application in NextJS with Typescript, and also working with PWA. 

My project has successfully implemented PWA. 
Make sure all components are responsive. All components (pop-up and others) have a background-transparent. and use Shadcn UI. Use the glassimorphism effect with bg-transparent and bg-blur-xl, implement an eye-catching view, and stunning animation.

The main focus is to implement those features in my application.

here is an embeded code for youtube 

```
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t8untvFKoAw?si=cxxIz1_SNos1eevo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

Task list 
1. create a froent-end to play the video like Youtube.
2. create a NextJS server to streaming the video from backend to froent-end.
3. make a dashboard for update the iframe code. 

My main focus is to hide the youtube url.
